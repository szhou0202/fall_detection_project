# Fall Detection Project 2020

This is the code for a fall detection and alerting system app. This application was created as a science fair project in AY 2019-2020 and was developed in Java using Android Studio. 
Through bluetooth, the app communicates with a wearable MetaMotionR (MMR) MbientLab sensor to gather the user's motion data. 
The app analyzes these signals, and if a fall pattern is detected, a stress call will be sent. 

The tutorial about MbientLab's MMR sensor can be found at [this link](https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/JaDevelopment.html).
